* Simple scene graph (ala Java3D) for dlang

** Threading
The implementation tries to enforce proper manipulation of the scene
graph data (meaning changing the graph only from the right (the
rendering) thread). For that each Node is either part of a scene
connected to a renderthread or not. If it is not (yet) connected, one
can do all the changes however one wants, if it is connected the
changes need to be done in the renderThread.
