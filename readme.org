#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS | DONE

* Simple scene graph (ala Java3D) for dlang

** Threading
The implementation tries to enforce proper manipulation of the scene
graph data (meaning changing the graph only from the right (the
rendering) thread). For that each Node is either part of a scene
connected to a renderthread or not. If it is not (yet) connected, one
can do all the changes however one wants, if it is connected the
changes need to be done in the renderThread.

* TODOS
** IN-PROGRESS implement image viewer
** TODO remove jpgs from git repository
** TODO show camera in scene from "outside"
** TODO add ui (e.g. nuklear or imgui)
** TODO links to nice explanation
** TODO praise learnopengl tutorial
** TODO make textures, normals and so on optional (or switch the vertex shader)

** DONE framerate e.g. between opengl33 and opengl2
   same same ...
** DONE continue opengl33

  was momentan da ist ist nicht korrekt ...
